# Dotty-dokka

## Getting started

For now the recommended way to try out our project would be:
 - Clone our [repository](https://github.com/Virtuslab/dotty-dokka)
 - Run `sbt main -o <output> -t <tasty-files> -cp <classpath>` where
   - `<output>`: location where documentation should be created
   - `<tasty-files>`: is list of dirs or jars that contains tasty files that should be documented
   - `<classpath>`: classpath that was used to generate tasty files 
   
   We also support `-d <documentation>` argument to provide static documentation. You can find more about that feature [here](main/static-page.html).
